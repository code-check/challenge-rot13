### Information

The goal of this challenge is to implement a simple chipher called "ROT13".

"ROT13" or "rotate by 13 places" works by replacing a character of the Latin alphabet by that which is 13 places away from it. 

As 'A' is the 1st character of the alphabet, it will be transformed to the 14th character, which is 'N'

Please make sure you also transform capital characters.

        <td>D</td>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Output</b></td>
        <td>N</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>P</td>
        <td>Q</td>
        <td>R</td>
        <td>S</td>

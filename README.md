## ROT13

The goal of this challenge is to implement a simple chipher called **ROT13**.

## Challenge Detail
- **ROT13** or "rotate by 13 places" works by replacing a character of the Latin alphabet by that which is 13 places away from it. 
- If `A` is the 1st character of the alphabet, it will be transformed to the 14th character, which is `N`.
- Please make sure you also transform capital characters.
- You should use [filename](filepath) to solve the challenge and can refer tests [here](filepath)

### Example

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Input</b></td>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Output</b></td>
        <td>N</td>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>P</td>
        <td>Q</td>
        <td>R</td>
        <td>S</td>
    </tr>
